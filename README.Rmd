The `R` package `csranks` provides statistical tools for estimation and inference involving ranks (the position in a ranking).  Two
central functions are `csranks` for confidence sets for ranks and `lmranks` for regressions involving ranks, e.g. rank-rank regressions that are 
popular in applied work in economics. 

The functions are based on recent work developing these procedures and their theoretical properties. The confidence sets for
ranks are based on [Mogstad, Romano, Shaikh, and Wilhelm (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1093/restud/rdad006) and 
[Bazylik, Mogstad, Romano, Shaikh, and Wilhelm (2022)](https://dwilhelm.userweb.mwn.de/papers/cwp4021.pdf). The inference methods
for regressions involving ranks are developed in [Chetverikov and Wilhelm (2023)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.15512).


## Installation

You can install the released version of `csranks` from CRAN with:

``` r
install.packages("csranks")
```

You can install the development version of `csranks` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("danielwilhelm/R-CS-ranks")
```

## Demo
