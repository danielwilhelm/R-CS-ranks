Description: Construct confidence sets for positions of populations in a ranking 
    based on values of a certain feature and their estimation errors. 
    Both simultaneous and marginal confidence sets are available, as well as 
    confidence sets with populations occupying top-n positions in the ranking.
    Theory based on Mogstad, Romano, Shaikh, and Wilhelm (2023)<doi:10.1093/restud/rdad006>.
