# csranks 1.2.3
* Fixed S3 inheritance for the `proj` method of `lmranks`. Added it to `lmranks` documentation page.
* Changed column names of `coefficients` in `summary.lmranks` from `t value` to `z value` and from `Pr(<|t|)` to `Pr(<|z|)`.
* Removed line about residual degrees of freedom from `print.summary.lmranks`.
* Example in `csranks` now calls `data(pisa2018)`.
* Clarified documentation of `csranks` function family.
* Improved documentation of `irank`, `frank`, etc
* Fixed typo in an error message
* Updated tests
